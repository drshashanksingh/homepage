{% if site.show_excerpts %}
    {% include "home.html" %}
{% else %}
    {% include "archive.html" title "Posts"%}find this post in your _posts directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
